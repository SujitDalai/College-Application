This project aims to develop an Android-based university management application to streamline and automate various university management processes, including notice management, 
faculty management, library management, access images and eBooks, etc. The project will use a combination of technologies such as Java, Android Studio & Firebase to 
develop a scalable, user-friendly, and secure application. The project will also address common challenges and limitations associated with university management applications, 
including integration with existing systems, scalability, user adoption, data privacy and security, accessibility, cost, technical limitations, and user experience.
Ultimately, this project aims to provide universities with an effective and efficient solution for managing their operations and enhancing the overall university 
experience for students, faculty, and staff.
